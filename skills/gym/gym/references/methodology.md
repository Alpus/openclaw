# Training Methodology Reference

## Core Sources (in priority order)

### 1. Helms' Training Pyramid

**Book**: Eric Helms, Andy Morgan, Andrea Valdez — _The Muscle and Strength Pyramids: Training_ (2nd ed., 2019)

Hierarchy of importance:

1. **Adherence** — best program is the one you do
2. **Volume** — total hard sets per muscle group per week
3. **Intensity of effort** — RPE/RIR, proximity to failure
4. **Progressive overload** — doing more over time
5. **Exercise selection** — compounds > isolation
6. **Rest periods** — 2-3 min compounds, 1-2 min isolation
7. **Advanced techniques** — marginal gains

### 2. Israetel's Volume Landmarks (Renaissance Periodization)

**Book**: Mike Israetel et al. — _Scientific Principles of Hypertrophy Training_ (2021)

| Landmark                  | Definition             | Typical Range    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| MV (Maintenance)          | Minimum to keep muscle | ~6 sets/week     |
| MEV (Minimum Effective)   | Minimum for growth     | ~8-10 sets/week  |
| MAV (Maximum Adaptive)    | Optimal growth zone    | ~12-20 sets/week |
| MRV (Maximum Recoverable) | Upper limit            | ~20-25 sets/week |

**Mesocycle structure**: Start at MEV, add 1-2 sets/muscle/week over 4-5 weeks → deload to MV for 1 week.

### 3. Schoenfeld Meta-Analyses

**Volume dose-response** (2017, PMID 27433992):

- Graded dose-response: more sets = more growth, up to ~20 sets/week
- ~0.24% increase per additional weekly set

**Frequency** (2019, PMID 30558493):

- ≥2x/week per muscle superior to 1x
- 3x shows trend toward further benefit

**Rep ranges** (2017, 2021):

- Hypertrophy similar across 5-30 reps when sets taken near failure
- 6-12 reps = best time-efficiency sweet spot

**Rest periods** (2016):

- 2-3 min rest > 1 min for both strength and hypertrophy

### 4. Protein (Morton et al. 2018)

- 1.6-2.2 g/kg/day — robust finding
- Upper ceiling of benefit: 2.2 g/kg
- Distribution: ≥0.4 g/kg per meal across 3-5 meals

## KPI Selection for Hypertrophy

### The Problem

"Get bigger" is not measurable. Need proxy metrics that:

1. Correlate strongly with muscle growth
2. Are influenced by each session (fast feedback loop)
3. Are easy to track
4. Can be shared / visualized simply

### Primary KPI: Estimated 1RM (e1RM)

**Formula**: e1RM = weight × (1 + reps/30) (Epley)

Why this is the best single metric:

- Captures both weight AND reps in one number
- Strength gains track closely with hypertrophy in intermediates (Schoenfeld 2017)
- Updates every session
- Easy to graph — one line per lift
- Intuitive: "my bench went from 98 to 110"

**Display**: 4 lines on one chart (Squat, Bench, OHP, Row/Pull). Each line should trend upward over weeks.

### Secondary KPIs

- **Weekly volume per muscle group** (hard sets) — are we in MAV zone?
- **Body weight** (weekly avg) — surplus/deficit tracking
- **Waist-to-chest ratio** — aesthetics proxy (waist stable + chest growing = winning)

### Tertiary (store, don't display by default)

- RPE per set
- All set-level data (reps, weight, rest)
- Heart rate / HRV from Apple Watch
- Sleep data
- Session duration
- Notes/comments

## Progressive Overload Schemes

### Double Progression (Recommended — Simple)

1. Pick rep range (e.g., 8-10)
2. Same weight until all sets at top of range
3. Add weight (+2.5 kg upper, +5 kg lower)
4. Drop to bottom of range
5. Repeat

### Volume Progression (Israetel)

- Week 1: MEV sets
- Week 2: +1-2 sets per muscle
- Week 3: +1-2 more
- Week 4-5: approaching MAV
- Week 6: Deload back to MV

### When to Switch Exercises

- Stagnation for 3+ sessions at same weight/reps
- Joint discomfort with specific movement
- Boredom (adherence matters!)
- Every 2-3 mesocycles, rotate variations

## Recovery Decision Tree

```
Feeling good, slept well → Full session as planned
Tired but functional → Full session, maybe -1 set per exercise
Very tired / bad sleep → Shortened session (3 compounds, 2 sets each)
Sick / injured → Skip. Rest. Come back when better.
```

## Deload Protocol

- Every 4-6 weeks OR when: stagnation on 3+ lifts, chronic fatigue, motivation drop
- Duration: 1 week
- Volume: 50% of normal (half the sets)
- Intensity: RPE 5-6 (comfortable weights)
- Same exercises as normal week
